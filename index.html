       <h2 class="post-title"><p>So you want to be a Data Viz Wizard? A guide for anyone interested in data visualization as a career.</p></h2>

        <p>The Data Visualization Society (DVS) disseminated its 2022 State of the Industry (SOTI) survey. A total of 1,568 visualizers shared their perspective, answering more than 70 questions about experience, salary, demographic details, roles (and many more). 
            We wanted to make this resource as an interactive career tool for anyone interested in data visualization. First, we want to let users explore salary by country, education, role, and gender. Does a higher education level increase the salary? 
            Are they paid fairly for their experience? Second, to better inform career decisions, we wanted to dig deeper into the everyday lives of data visualizers and how they spend their time. Data visualization encompasses more than creating charts. 
            It involves various stages such as data preparation, analysis, brainstorming ideas, and, of course, the actual creation of visualizations. Additionally, data visualizers often engage in a range of other tasks, such as coding or teaching. 
            The objective of this visualization is to investigate how different job roles allocate their time for data visualization and to help individuals determine their own place and preferences. 
            Our goal is to ensure that this functionality is user-friendly and straightforward. Simultaneously, the visualization provides a narrative through text, enhancing the overall experience.
